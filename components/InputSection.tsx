Treasurer Report
The balances in our accounts are as follows:
BAMJ08 (Budget): $2,564.33
BAMK08 (Fundraising): $1,547.89
We are still waiting for the invoice from Boards ‘R Us. Our order came in under budget so some of that money will be going back into our budget account.

Secretary's Report
No report at this time.

Old Business
Our event registration for the Skate Board workshop was approved. We need to submit the Room Reservation Form to Mark Massinda to book Webb Lawn for the 20th of April. C. Spaulding volunteered to take care of this. We will vote on the funding for this event next week.
We need to discuss our Trip to NY on April 28th. The hotel faxed us an invoice for $1,010.00. We were able to get University Vans to drive down there but they will cost $20 to park them for the weekend. We also need to decide if we are going to pay for meals for those going.

Motion #11: (M. Spaulding/Brown) To allocate $1,010.00 in a Purchase Order to the Best Western to pay for our hotel for April 28th out of our budget account.
8 in favor/0 opposed/0 abstentions. Motion Carries

Motion #12: (Caplette/Tynan) To allocate $20.00 in a cash advance to KayTe Bettencourt to pay for parking in NY for the night of April 18th from our budget account.
8 in favor/0 opposed/0 abstentions. Motion Carries

The most that we could give each person for their meals for the two days is $96.00. We are bringing 20 people. If we gave each person the max that would be $1,920.00 This money is coming out of our fundraising account. We want to pay for as much as we can as those going are paying for the skate expo on their own but we don't want to wipe out our fundraising account.

Motion #13: (Brown/Casie) To allocate $1,000.00 ($50 per person) for meals in a cash advance to Valerie Nettleton for our trip to NY on the 18th from our fundraising account.
6 in favor/2 opposed/0 abstentions. Motion Carries

New Business

Announcements
